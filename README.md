# Leaflet_challenge

### Project Overview
This project uses JavaScript and the Leaflet library to visualize earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey. The map displays markers for earthquakes of various magnitudes and depths, with the color and size of the markers indicating the depth and magnitude of each earthquake, respectively. The data the feeds this map is updated from the United States Geological Survey (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/) every minute. Users can toggle between different datasets to view earthquakes of different magnitudes for the past 30 days. Additionally, the tectonic plates were added to the map to show the relationship between those areas and earthquake activity. The GeoJSON that was used to add the plate features was sourced from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json.

### Technologies Used:
- JavaScript
- Leaflet.js
- D3.js
- Bootstrap

### Instructions
To view the earthquake map, navigate to the GitHub Pages site for this project. The map will load automatically, displaying markers for all global earthquakes from the past month. To view earthquakes from a different time period or magnitude range, use the layer control on the top-right corner of the map to toggle between different datasets. To view more information about a specific earthquake, click on the corresponding marker to display a popup with information about the magnitude, depth, and location of the earthquake.
